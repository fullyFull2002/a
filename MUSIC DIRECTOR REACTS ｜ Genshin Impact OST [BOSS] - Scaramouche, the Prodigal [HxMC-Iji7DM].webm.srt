00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Hello and welcome in, my name is Drumroll Tony, I'm a streamer on Twitch, musician and

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,800
music teacher living in Seattle.

This is awesome.

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,240
It feels good.

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,240
I'm excited to keep this going.

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,960
All right, we're going to be checking out some video game music.

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,400
This is a recommended video for one of my Patreon members, and this is going to be Genshin

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,300
Impact, Scaramouche, The Prodigal, all phases, some boss music here, and it looks long.

14
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,440
In the description here we have the introduction, phase one, phase two before the cutscene, and

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,520
then phase two.

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,040
So yeah, let's check it out.

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,520
All right, we're going to dig in here.

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,800
I can see, I'm just scrubbing along here.

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,840
I can see the introduction goes all the way up to the minute 37 mark.

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:01:01,080
We'll try to get that and see what's going on here.

21
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:12,080
Okay.

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
That's pretty good.

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,000
Cool little woodwind melody that came in there, but hold on.

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,480
We got to talk about, it's probably a prepared piano.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,120
We're getting this mysterious kind of dark clock sounding, this like low end strike.

26
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,520
We're striking the string.

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,040
You know, sometimes we get to do fun stuff with the piano, mess it all up and play on

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
it in different ways.

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
Pretty good.

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,280
The little responses and the tremolos and the strings, very, very, very creepy.

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:49,760
Let's go back a couple seconds here and get into this woodwind melody.

32
00:01:49,760 --> 00:02:03,320
This is the first one we're going to be playing.

33
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:14,400
The low brass is in tune, so good.

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:33,920
We'll give it a try.

35
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:55,000
What an amazing introduction.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,280
Okay.

37
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,960
The obvious stuff we talked about that clock, that mysterious clock

38
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,960
sound on the prepared piano that's dead constant the whole time.

39
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,160
And we had this really great shift between the strings and the woodwinds

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:10,520
playing our whatever, whatever, I'm a lot of phrase there, but this is the

41
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,040
transitions and I was orchestrated and written between the players.

42
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,160
Really, really great.

43
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,800
Sounds like kind of a intimate, intimate, uh, pit setting, like front, like down

44
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,320
in the musical down, down what's in the pit.

45
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,920
Oh, very, very, very cool.

46
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,040
We'd love to play something like this.

47
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,280
Okay.

48
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,520
Let's go back a couple seconds here and grab, I guess we're into the phase one.

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:37,520
Let's get this.

50
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,720
Wow.

51
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,160
Okay.

52
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,280
Uh, check it that they could, that they could, that we have this

53
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,480
big, uh, threes triplet, uh, foundation.

54
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,400
So are they real shakers or the digital?

55
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Cause I know a lot of people that I've played with, I can play

56
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,760
with the shakers and it sounds very like little eggs.

57
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,960
Sounds very, very good.

58
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,920
Did you hear the little intimate triangle work in the background?

59
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,000
People give triangle players a lot of crap, but you shouldn't.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,920
It's a delicate instrument.

61
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,520
Very cool.

62
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,880
And in case you didn't know, it's not like it's this one person that only

63
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,320
plays a triangle percussionist play like everything in the concert percussion

64
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,280
realm, which you do, you know what sometime we should do if you've done that.

65
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,240
Anyway, let's go back five and keep going.

66
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:54,320
Cause it sounds like this is about to get real big here.

67
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:29,320
Wow.

68
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,800
Okay.

69
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,080
Uh, it almost felt like a metric modulation.

70
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,320
It wasn't cause I was getting, I was getting confused because when we started

71
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,440
with our string involvement, where it was like still deep and brooding and evil

72
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,960
sounding, and then the bait that digital, we'd like this really smooth transition

73
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,680
from like string and woodwinds and then incorporated digital stuff.

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,240
Uh, very, very cool.

75
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,880
Great ideas.

76
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,160
But then that bonk, I was like, wait, is this like a displaced, like dotted

77
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,400
eighth rhythm or maybe like a quarter of a triple thing where we go on somewhere

78
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,040
new and then it came in and I feel like we had a one, two, three, one, two,

79
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,960
three, one, two, three, one, two, three, buckle, buckle, but we had some, that

80
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,240
kind of combination going on for the meter.

81
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,040
I'm not totally sure.

82
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,040
Cause we just heard it.

83
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,200
There was a lot of things to listen to and there's like epic choir stuff happening.

84
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,520
This is amazing.

85
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:35,040
So far.

86
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:47,440
interesting boogadat boogadat boogadat doogadat doogadat doogadat is our main kind of formulation

87
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,320
of rhythmic melody that going on there um evil i say evil all the time i don't think

88
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,040
everything's evil but um those voices without effects just sound big and dark so i don't

89
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,480
know what kind of boss we're fighting in this game at this point but uh i'd probably not

90
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,840
want to be the boss just so i can keep listening to the music all right we're going back five

91
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:25,160
here we go

92
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:42,600
that was cool we always ask for it's like every day i'm like hey what do you do what

93
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,160
do you want to create stuff that's new take away a layer and build it back up it's good

94
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,480
it's uh it's like the solid you know it's solid goal right there you'll you'll achieve

95
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,240
it every time great use of it i really like those big triplets that we came out of though

96
00:07:53,240 --> 00:08:17,640
that was fun we'll go back five and grab that again

97
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:32,480
even in there there's still layers going on the predominant voice obviously is the big

98
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,880
whoa that sound in the vocal layer but we have strings and low brass supporting all

99
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,480
of that um it's interesting to think about how loud this is right we've arrived and we

100
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,120
just kind of stayed at this dynamic level so clearly a lot of stuff is happening with

101
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,920
what's going on with how they program these to work with how you're fighting the boss

102
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,680
so that that alone always interests me quite a bit like how video game music works but

103
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,440
um obviously we're just kind of the linear straight playthrough so we're not gonna have

104
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,240
too much deviation but still it's big and just uh your ears are getting you're getting

105
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:14,040
run in here okay so that was phase one now we're at phase two before the cut scene

106
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,600
here we go

107
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
very cool

108
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:46,520
all right so we got to talk about the combination of three

109
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:54,840
so you're probably feeling it now but in reality we're still because all that can still be

110
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,120
divided down to right here where everything in this piece has been super slow the beginning

111
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,680
was a little slower but all phase one we still pulled right here at this tempo and technically

112
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,680
we're still there but we've just added a bunch of stuff on top to augment it but just know

113
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,840
just know the root foundations are still present we just got these like triplet grooves going

114
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:40,360
on i'm just gonna go back like right here

115
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:50,040
very interesting use of like the you know the movie theater bass drops so that kind

116
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,200
of stuff we have that with like but it's like super palsy and like fuzzy and buzzy um we

117
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,600
do still have remember the shaker the egg shaker triplet kind of figure that's still

118
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,220
present now but definitely in a way more digital environment so that's fun how that has existed

119
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:30,640
across this this cutscene bar line though all right back five let's keep going

120
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,720
before we go any further the church organ part was pretty cool because that like um

121
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:41,520
harmonically was like what kept us together thinking in bomb that's where our harmonic

122
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,120
structure is even though we have boom doom to goo goo goo goo goo and all this weird like

123
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:54,240
digital stuff happening the organ is definitely our like tonal center so that was pretty fun

124
00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:12,480
this too all right so before the drop hits we got to talk about a different tempo and

125
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:20,400
then we have this is our focus bump bump oh oh four and talk about all the time it's bossa

126
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,680
nova dude that's straight up bossa nova but we're using it in a very different form here

127
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,040
so it doesn't sound like brazilian music whatsoever but that's where those rhythms came from all

128
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:08,880
right very cool so the whole time like if you're someone that's an orchestrator you're

129
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,640
a young composer you're like thinking about how do i layer stuff this is how you layer

130
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,320
stuff you keep things right boom right here and you add everything on top of that with

131
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,900
whatever is going on there's like a million strings there's all the digital like bass

132
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:26,300
drop stuff we have the there's that violin part that's coming in and jamming out there

133
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,880
and then you have your choir just obviously uh laying it in your ears letting you know

134
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:34,480
where you're at but it's it's all there we're just really literally over one chord and we

135
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,480
just kind of build on the extensions of that chord sounds great though like there's nothing

136
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:51,080
wrong with that that definitely sounds amazing back five let's keep going

137
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,080
cool

138
00:13:52,080 --> 00:14:17,680
so melodically we have a lot of different intervals going on and compared to um we could

139
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,800
we could say we're in a mode versus what we were before where basically everything kind

140
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,760
of function around one two flat three which is very minorish uh i'm not gonna sing that

141
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:29,600
right because i i'm a drummer first and foremost in the bass player not a vocalist but point

142
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,260
me now we're seeing more of like uh phrygian ish with a lot of flat two stuff happening

143
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,320
that won't really if if you don't care about like scale stuff that stuff doesn't really

144
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,340
mean anything but just know that the scale composition is similar but we've added a couple

145
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,120
things in so we're going through some modes to give it that you know like that sound you're

146
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,680
like oh i might have heard that like in like a movie like it sounds like you know a different

147
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,380
part of the world yes it does because uh expected scale systems differ or just different folks

148
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,880
use different things okay so it's very it's very it's very cool it's all on purpose very

149
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,880
good it's very good

150
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:25,240
the reason i made that face because then suddenly we went from what i just mentioned a second

151
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,320
ago and now we're way more traditional the way chords are functioning

152
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:35,680
and suddenly it has a lot more like i don't know late classical baroque stuff going on

153
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,640
there's someone smarter than me that has way better aural uh identifiable identify skills

154
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,040
that have to do that because i just can't but it's funny how quickly that shifted so

155
00:15:45,040 --> 00:16:03,520
definitely enjoyable to listen to though

156
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,920
i'm sorry to keep stop so much but there's so much cool stuff to talk about uh the little

157
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,240
violin line that button yeah that was pretty sick but what's really different here is the

158
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,940
do going on underneath that after we just came out of all that other stuff that is a

159
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:46,920
huge shift in the lower end percussion layer there that's pretty wild

160
00:16:46,920 --> 00:17:04,840
okay

161
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
okay

162
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:45,080
So when someone says, well, what kind of, you know, what kind of piece is this?

163
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,460
You just say, yes, it's like, how many styles are we going to hear back to back?

164
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,460
That's pretty fun.

165
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:54,640
It is like completely like, it's interesting when you study music, like in a traditional

166
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,040
standpoint, this is very not traditional, right?

167
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,200
We don't normally like jump thousands of miles of musical influence, like global influence,

168
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,560
but now we do.

169
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,400
I mean, not saying it's bad, not saying it's good.

170
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
I'm just saying it's cool.

171
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,440
And like, it's a fun thing to experience in your headset.

172
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,720
Like in a matter of seconds, you're like, wow, we've totally, we're just jumping over

173
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
time periods.

174
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
We're jumping across the world.

175
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
Very, very cool.

176
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
It's just different.

177
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
All right.

178
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,720
Let's take it out.

179
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:47,560
What a great piece of music.

180
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:53,040
The end, the unison lines there between voice and brass and strings, and then setting it

181
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,680
home with our percussion hits.

182
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,800
Outstanding stuff.

183
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,600
I would love to know if any of you that watch these videos are composition majors or you're

184
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,960
working on writing music or what kind of stuff you do.

185
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Maybe you're want to be, you know, be writing music for video games down the road or maybe

186
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
cinematic stuff.

187
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,040
