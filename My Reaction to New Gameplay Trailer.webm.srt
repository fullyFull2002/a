1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,440
Alrighty, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome back to another Genshin Impact reaction

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,440
video.

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,760
This is going to be a pretty short one.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,360
We are in the kind of dry spell before version 3.3 comes out.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:19,120
HoyoVerse dropped a trailer yesterday for the Genius Invocation TCG.

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,300
It has Diona, Fischl, and the Traveler on the thumbnail.

7
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:24,080
So it's new gameplay trailer.

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,240
Let's play Genius Invocation TCG.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,240
It's a minute and a half.

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,560
I was recommended to check it out.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,040
I guess it's pretty hype for the card game that's coming out as a permanent game mode

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,040
in the next patch.

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,040
Yeah, we're going to check this out.

14
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,160
I hope you guys enjoy.

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,840
We are live at my Twitch channel, twitch.tv forward slash murder of birds.

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,660
With all of that said, we are going to be starting new gameplay trailer.

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,160
Let's play Genius Invocation TCG.

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,760
Whoa, whoa, hold on.

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,520
Are we going into the cat's tail?

20
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,560
Oh, wait, that's inside.

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:01:01,920
Yo, Ellen just beat his ass, get up girl.

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,920
Oh my God.

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,320
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

24
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,160
I called this.

25
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
Hold on.

26
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:14,960
Guys, guys, I'm a ghost writer.

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,760
I literally asked for this last year.

28
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
Hold on, hold on.

29
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,760
Pause champ.

30
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,760
I got to find this.

31
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,760
I got to find this.

32
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
I got to find this.

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,760
I got to find this.

34
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
I got to find this.

35
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,240
When I did Diona's hangout last year.

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,240
No, you did not.

37
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,240
I'm going to find the proof.

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,620
I'm finding it right now and I'm going to show all of you.

39
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,840
This is my Genshin Impact playlist during the year the game released.

40
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,440
I did Diona's hangout on July 4th, 4th of July, 2021.

41
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,720
Give me one second.

42
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,520
So this is the video in question and this is the moment that I'm referring to.

43
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
Hold on.

44
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,520
I think it's right after this.

45
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,640
Anyway, if you want to check out the cat's tail for yourself, the entrance is just around

46
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,640
dude.

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,760
I wish the cat's tail.

48
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,800
I wish, so here's something that I really hope miHoYo does in the future.

49
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:00,160
I want to be able to go inside the, the cat's tail.

50
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,520
I want to, and I want to be able to go inside the adventurers guild headquarters.

51
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,880
I, you know what I mean?

52
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,200
Like we get to go inside the angel share tavern.

53
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,960
We get to go inside the Knights of Favonius headquarters.

54
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,640
We get to go into the church.

55
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:20,320
Like these are two other well-established locations in the city and I, it's always bothered

56
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,960
me that we never get to go in there, especially since we are a, an adventurer technically,

57
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,960
you know what I mean?

58
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,960
I'm fucking AR 57.

59
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,760
You tell me I can't go in the building, add it to the list, boys.

60
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Let's go.

61
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
Let's carry on.

62
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
I manifested this.

63
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Okay.

64
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
Everyone that's hyped for this.

65
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,760
You're welcome.

66
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,760
Oh, the gang.

67
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,360
Oh my God.

68
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,640
This is so cool.

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,560
We finally get to go inside.

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
Okay.

71
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
All right.

72
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,560
Let's see what's in there.

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Oh shit.

74
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,560
The music.

75
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,560
No.

76
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Wow.

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
Yo.

78
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,560
I'll call these a card.

79
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
Yup.

80
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
Sing show.

81
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
This is so sick.

82
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Wow.

83
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
Welcome to the cat's tail.

84
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,560
Ah, what a nice surprise.

85
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Don't tell me you came to learn genius and vocation TCG without bringing any card.

86
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
It's time to see what you are made of.

87
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
Oh my God.

88
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Oh my God.

89
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,560
Oh my God.

90
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,560
Oh my God.

91
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
Oh my God.

92
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
Oh my God.

93
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
Oh my God.

94
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,560
Oh my God.

95
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,560
Oh my God.

96
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Oh my God.

97
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,560
Oh my God.

98
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,680
Oh minute card.

99
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,840
I'm so excited for this game.

100
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,760
Do we get the first?

101
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
All of them.

102
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,760
Yeah.

103
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,760
The pretty caterpillar saw him in the trailer in the.

104
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,880
Live stream.

105
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,880
No, this music goes in the minute.

106
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,380
Charles and Chloe.

107
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,480
I'm sorry.

108
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,540
Chongyun as well.

109
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,780
You know, that was actually kind of hype.

110
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:53,140
We have an animal hypostasis card. We have guoba, osvaldo, von hafnavines. We got a bunch of animation cards. That looks sick

111
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:59,140
Wow, they really went all out on this card game. There's a catherine card as well. Wow. This looks really really good, dude

112
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:05,220
It's so fucking cool that we're in the freaking the tavern itself. Oh, we're in the cat's tail like bar itself

113
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,300
Yeah, i'm gonna suck at this card game too, by the way, because i'm not very good at card games

114
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,660
But i'm definitely down to verse the npcs and like first like a bunch of the playable characters

115
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,660
Look, i'm going to be able to verse sino

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,780
official

117
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,380
Uh sucrose

118
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,820
I love that collie's a card like a bunch of my favorite characters are playable cards

119
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,500
And the element like they basically gave everyone like a card version of an elemental burst, which is super cool

120
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,740
What a nice surprise. Yeah, I think that's margaret talking to learn genius invocation tcg without bringing any cards

121
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:44,580
It is time to see what you are made of god. This is so sick. The music is really good, too

122
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:58,580
Prince I wonder if we get to duel the king of games right there the car the freaking the card cat the cat card cat

123
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,620
Nice

124
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,100
Wow, that was pretty hype. They also advertised the card game. I think today's kaya's birthday as well

125
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:12,900
They advertised the card game through kaya's birthday letter and I was just like damn, bro

126
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,540
Y'all are down bad for this card game. Jesus christ

127
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,180
Yeah, I have no idea how the card game works

128
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,380
Like I know that there are people already talking about stuff in it

129
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:25,540
But um, I i'm just gonna wait for it to come out in game. I need to collect the cards

130
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,620
I need to find out like the best decks possible to build that's gonna be exciting

131
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,660
like I already look at people's guides for like character builds if i'm looking for inspiration or if I

132
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,900
Want to find the most optimal build possible

133
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:41,060
But the cards are gonna be really interesting to figure out because you know

134
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,540
You you're gonna need the best cards to beat the npcs

135
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,060
but then you're gonna need like

136
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:51,220
The actual good cards to if you when you go up against people in pvp if you care about that stuff pvp doesn't really have

137
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,140
Um pvp you don't get rewards or anything like that. There's like no leaderboards for it either

138
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,140
So like realistically speaking like there's nothing to gain from losing

139
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,900
I mean, there's nothing to gain really from winning other than keeping your own personal record

140
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,860
I guess but uh

141
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,700
or if you want to like do if you want to host tournaments with your friends or like if you want to do like a

142
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,380
Community function or something like that

143
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,700
But uh, yeah for me at least i'm like super super super excited to just get the cards and to just see how they work

144
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,820
And to go up against other playable characters like sino like fischl and characters from all over the game

145
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,660
So i'm really really excited for that

146
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:30,340
I would also it would also be super cool if someone literally started playing genshin for the sole purpose of building up their cards

147
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,500
And their deck and then play this on stream

148
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:40,260
Like I wouldn't be I wouldn't be upset if there were just like ingenious invocation tcg dedicated streamers and like content creators

149
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:44,100
I think that'd be kind of cool. I just hope that they update the game as it goes on

150
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,580
I think everybody should have a card in the game, too

151
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,020
I think every playable character should have a card. I think every mob should have a card

152
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:55,300
I think every like significant npc should have a card like they have a catherine card. They have a libin card

153
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,860
They should have a wagner card. They should have a

154
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,740
Masanori card like even cards like connected to lore like an enjo card

155
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,420
Alumine card, that'd be kind of cool depends on like the the function of the card itself. That would be really really hype

156
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,500
It would be cool if they updated the card system every time a new character comes out

157
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,860
So scaramouche and farzen are coming out on 3.3

158
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,980
It'd be cool if every character also came with a card added to like the roster of cards in the shop

159
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,180
I think that would be really neat

160
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,740
It really just depends it depends on how they want to how far they want to take this card game or if what we see

161
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:32,420
Is what we'll ever get but they they rotate spiral abyss like spiral abyss isn't the same that it was when it initially came out

162
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
So while spiral abyss hasn't changed

163
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,620
Fundamentally, it does go through cycles and changes

164
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,100
So I hope I hope that it does with the card game as well because a lot of people are really hyped for this

165
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:48,020
I'm not hyped from like a meta or like a competitive standpoint, but that does breed more

166
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:51,140
Interest for the general community and i'm excited to just see

167
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,340
How far people take the card game how serious they take it because i'm a big fan of like competitive scenes and stuff like that

168
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,380
And if it's genshin, you know, i'll definitely check it out. But uh, yeah, this was pretty awesome. This is pretty great

169
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:06,420
We actually get to go into the uh, the uh, the we actually get to go inside the cat's tail bar

170
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:13,300
So that gives me hope that in the far flung future we'll actually be able to go into the adventurers guild

171
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,060
headquarters be at the one in monstad or maybe we'll go to the official one in

172
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,420
Snejnaja since that is where the adventurers guild is originally hosted and and founded but um, but yeah

173
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,780
That's gonna do it for this video. Thank you guys all so much for watching

174
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,380
I know it's a pretty lengthy video for such a short trailer, but uh, we're kind of at the tail end of content right now

175
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,780
I I still have nahita's quest to do i'm gonna be doing that tomorrow. I have character lore to read

176
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,460
We're going to be going through the picture event today. So I really appreciate all the support
